Clustering
##########

Clustering can be used to identify different groups of documents with similar information, in an unsupervised fashion.
Despite it's ability to provide valuable insights into your data, you do not need labeled data for clustering. `wordview` provide 
a clustering API with options across vectorization models and clustering algorithms to ensure that you have access to a wide range
of experiment state in order to find the most suitable model.
